After that, we can go for:
📖 Adding a PDF/ePub viewer inside the app
🖊️ Adding shared highlights/annotations saved per user

🌟 Next Step (Recommended Path)

You’ve already got:
✅ Database setup
✅ File uploads working

So your next move can be:

Add a click event on each book item that routes to /reader/:id

Create a Reader component (PDF or EPUB version)

Pass the file_url to that reader

🪄 Optional (Next)

Once this runs smoothly, you can:

Add Next/Prev page buttons for PDFs

Add highlight/annotation tools later

Store your last-read page in Supabase so you both can resume reading at the same spot

🧠 Optional Enhancements Later

Add progress bars during upload.

Add delete/edit book options.

Restrict file types and size.

Store user who uploaded the book.

🪄 Bonus (Optional)

Later, we can extend this real-time feature to:

Show when your partner is reading the same book

Sync highlights and annotations live

Notify each other when a new note or highlight appears
